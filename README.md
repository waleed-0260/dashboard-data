This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

IT IS A NEXT JS BASED PROJECT ON THE LATEST VERSION ADN FOR THE UI WE HAVE USED TAIWLIND CSS AND SHADCN.

WHILE MAKING THE UI WE USE THE SIDEBAR COMPONENT AND THE TABLE COMPONENT FROM THE SHADCN THEN FOR THE LITTLE BIT OF STYLING WE HAVE USED TAILWIND CSS

ON THE FUNCTIONALITY PART WE HAVE FIRST FETCHES THE DATA USING REACT QUERY ( NO NEXT JS SERVER SIDE RENDERING USED) AFTER THAT THE API IS THERE AND WE CAN NOT ADD DATA DIRECTLY TO THE SERVER THAT WILL BE SAVED TO THE SERVER AND STAY THERE WE HAVE USED THE REACT QUERY MUTATION AND CHACHING SO THE UPDATED DATA CAN BE THERE EVEN FOR THE  LOCAL ONLY THEN WE MADE FUNCTIONALITIES OF POSTING, DELETING OR UPDATING DATA.
